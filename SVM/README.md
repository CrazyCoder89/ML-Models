# 🧭 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This folder contains an implementation of the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm from scratch — a powerful supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.

---

## 🧠 What is SVM?

Support Vector Machine is a **supervised learning algorithm** that finds the **optimal decision boundary (hyperplane)** that best separates data into different classes. It focuses on maximizing the **margin** between the data points of different classes — making it robust and effective, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

Unlike Logistic Regression, SVM doesn’t output probabilities. Instead, it focuses on finding the most confident boundary between classes.

### 🔍 Visual Explanation

SVM works by identifying **support vectors** (the data points closest to the decision boundary) and ensuring the **maximum margin** between these vectors and the hyperplane.

## ✅ Advantages

- 🔹 Works well in **high-dimensional** spaces
- 🔹 Effective when the number of features is greater than the number of samples
- 🔹 Robust to overfitting (especially with the right kernel)
- 🔹 Supports different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF)

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- 🔸 Computationally intensive on large datasets
- 🔸 Harder to tune (especially when using non-linear kernels)
- 🔸 Does not directly provide class probabilities
- 🔸 Less interpretable than simpler models like logistic regression

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

- 🩺 **Medical diagnosis**: Classifying tumors as benign or malignant
- 📧 **Spam detection**: Identifying spam vs. legitimate emails
- 👁️ **Face recognition**: Detecting and classifying human faces
- 💳 **Fraud detection**: Spotting fraudulent transactions
- 🐾 **Image classification**: Labeling objects in images
