# 🧠 ML Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to the repository where machine learning algorithms are built **from the ground up** — no libraries, no shortcuts. Each algorithm has its own folder with a clear, line-by-line implementation.

## ✅ Currently Implemented
- 📈 **Linear Regression**
- 🔐 **Logistic Regression**
- 🧩 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

More algorithms (KNN, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, etc.) coming soon...

## 💡 Why This Repo?

Most tutorials teach you how to *use* ML libraries.  
This repo helps you **build those libraries** — line by line.

- 🧠 Learn how algorithms really work  
- 🔧 Practice math-to-code thinking  
- 🎯 Prepare for interviews or exams  
- 📚 Build a solid ML foundation
